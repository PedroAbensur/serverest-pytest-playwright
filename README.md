    ## Frontend (E2E) Tests

    ### Test Case #1: User registration, logout, and login

    | **Test ID**         | `E2E-FRONT-001`                        |
    |---------------------|----------------------------------------|
    | **Description**     | Validates that a user can register, log out, and log back in successfully. |
    | **Initial Setup**   | None                                   |
    | **Test Steps**      | 1. Register random user <br/> 2. Check if registered user is in home page <br/> 3. Log out from account <br/> 4. Log in from registered account before <br/> 5. Check if logged user is in home page |
    | **Expected Result** | User is redirected to home page after registration and login.               |

    ### Test Case #2: Product registration by admin and verification in the product listing

    | **Test ID**         | `E2E-FRONT-002`                              |
    |---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
    | **Description**     | Admin registers a product and verifies its presence in the product listing, as well as the duplicated error when trying to create it again. |
    | **Initial Setup**   | Log into admin account                          |
    | **Test Steps**      | 1. Register the product as Admin User <br/> 2. Check if the product is in Product Listing <br/> 3. Try to register same product again <br/> 4. Check error that shows that product already exists|
    | **Expected Result** | 1. Product created is listed with correct name and visible to admin <br/> 2. When trying to create product with same name, error is shown on screen             |

    ---

    ### Test Case #3: Product registration by admin and addition to buyer's shopping list

    | **Test ID**         | `E2E-FRONT-003`                              |
    |---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
    | **Description**     | Tests product creation by admin and addition by buyer to shopping list. |
    | **Initial Setup**   | 1. Log into Admin Account <br/> 2. Register a Random Product <br/> 3. Check if product is registered correctly <br/> 4. Logout from admin account|
    | **Test Steps**      | 1. Register and log in as new user <br/> 2. Search product added in Initial Setup <br/> 3. Add it to Shopping List <br/> 4. Assert that product is present in Shopping List|
    | **Expected Result** | Product is present in shopping list with quantity = 1               |

    ## API Tests

    ### Test Case #1: User creation and duplicate email validation test

    | **Test ID**         | `API-001`                                  |
    |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
    | **Description**     | Tests user creation and error when trying to register an existing email. |
    | **Initial Setup**   | None                                        |
    | **Test Steps**      | 1. Register an user using the API and assert it is created <br/> 2. Try to register the same user from Step 1 and assert it cannot be done |
    | **Expected Result** | 1. User can be succesfully registered <br/> 2. When trying to create user with same information API returns error.                  |

    ### Test Case #2: Product creation and duplicate validation test with product listing verification

    | **Test ID**         | `API-002`                                  |

    | **Description**     | Product is created via API and duplicate creation is rejected.              |
    | **Initial Setup**   | Admin token generated (conftest fixture)                       |
    | **Test Steps**      | 1. Create a product via the API as Admin User, using the Admin Token <br/> 2. Get the Products array using the API <br/> 3. Search and assert the product is present in products array got from API|
    | **Expected Result** | Product is succesfully created by the Admin and validated it exists in the products listing             |
